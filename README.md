# Distributed-Client-Server-Synchronization

This project was the second among the 5 amazing projects of the '95-702 - Distributed Systems for Information Systems Management' course at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). The course was taught by 3 eminent Professors of CMU - Prof. Mike McCarthy, Prof. Joe Mertz and Prof. Marty Barrett.

- Built various applications in Java using client-side and server-side UDP and TCP sockets.

- Implemented a malicious player-in-the-middle attack to understand its effect on client-server interactions.

- Created a remote variable system enabling clients to request mathematical operations from the server via UDP protocol.

- Incorporated a signing mechanism utilizing RSA public and private keys for client authentication and server-side verification.

- Applied Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to compartmentalize communication code from application code.
